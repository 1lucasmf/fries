changelog.txt

June 12, 2013 changes:
- Adding data-transition="pop" to links now pops the history stack (works like back button) regardless of the href attribute. Just add a fallback href so when stack.js fails, it will still go to the desired page
- Added initial styles and an example for on/off switches
- Added a global box-sizing: border-box
- Changed background color of primary button's active state to rgba() value with 80% opacity
- Stack.js now only calls event.preventDefault() when the target is valid
- Modified tabs.js so that it doesn't add the anchor hash to the address bar
