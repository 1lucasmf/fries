# Fries

Fries is an awesome mobile prototyping framework for Android apps inspired by [Ratchet]. 
We all know that you can find loads of iOS prototyping tools out there, so this time 
let's give some love to Android.


## Getting Started

Read the [docs] to see it in action.


## Development Roadmap

Fries aims to make prototyping Android apps fast and easy. In the long run, these are 
the following features and components that I think should be added to Fries:

* Modals
* Form Elements
* Shelf (a la Facebook or Path style menu)
* Loading Indicator
* Custom Scroller (iScroll is great but Fries aims to be as close to an Android app as possible)
* Typography
* Holo Light Theme


## Browser Compatibility

Coming soon as Fries is currently being deep fried in most modern mobile browsers.


## Other Notes

Fries uses [Push.js], also from Ratchet, to piece together all pages for the prototype.
You might want to read about it before using Fries.


## Special Thanks

I'd like to thank [Dave Gamache], [Connor Sears], and [Jacob Thornton] for a wonderful job on [Ratchet].
Also, Fries' scroll bars are made using [iScroll 4] by [Matteo Spinelli]. Kudos to you guys.
