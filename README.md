# Fries

Fries is an awesome mobile development framework (yes, not just for prototyping!) 
for Android apps using just HTML, CSS, and Javascript and was inspired by [Ratchet].
We all know that you can find loads of iOS development tools out there, 
so this time let's give some love to Android.


## Version 1.0.1

In the next few weeks I'm planning to release version `1.0.1` of Fries and here's the list
of things that I want to be included in it:

* SASS/SCSS support for easier theming
* Theme customization examples
* Automation of tasks using [Grunt]
* Form Switches (checkboxes, radio, and on/off switches)
* Textarea styling
* Toast Notifications
* Automatic resizing of the action bars to 40px on landscape orientation
* Replace the CSS up/back chevron on the action bar with official Android up/back icon
* A better documentation of each component

Check out the [changelog] before doing any of these. As they might already been implemented on
the current development branch.
